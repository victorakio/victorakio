## Hi ðŸ˜„

### I'm a Front-end and WordPress Developer ðŸ’»

Here are some of the technologies I work with:

__React | NextJS | Typescript | WordPress | PHP | JS | SASS | MySQL | Jest | Cypress | Playwright | NodeJS__

I've been working with front-end development for 9 years, focusing on delivering the best solutions with quality and performance.

I'm always looking forward to new ways of thinking and adding more value to the projects that I'm a part of, currently, I work with tools like Javascript, React, NextJS, Typescript, Jest, Cypress, Playwright, Datadog, WordPress, and PHP.
